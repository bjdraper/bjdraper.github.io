I am a final year PhD candidate at the University of Sheffield currently working on a Bioinformatics project in collaboration with Lonza Biologics.
My biological research interests include: Transcriptomics, Alternative Splicing, Synthetic Biology and RNA Biology.
Broader research interests include Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLM) and Deep Learning.

Industry supported Research
======
I have a passion for integrating cutting-edge data analytics to optimize and innovate in the biopharma industry. 
Beyond my primary academic responsibilities I am fascinated with linguistics and machine learning and I am currently reading about how large language models such as BERT can be trained to understand and decipher biological sequence data such as DNA and Amino Acid sequences.
